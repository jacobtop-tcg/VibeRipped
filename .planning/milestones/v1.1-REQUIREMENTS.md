# Requirements: VibeRipped

**Defined:** 2026-02-09
**Core Value:** Every "model is thinking" moment produces exactly one unambiguous physical action — no decisions, no coaching, no friction.

## v1.1 Requirements

Requirements for v1.1 Polish & Intelligence release. Each maps to roadmap phases.

### Distribution

- [x] **DIST-01**: User can install VibeRipped globally via `npm i -g viberipped` and run `vibripped` from any directory
- [x] **DIST-02**: Repository includes README with install instructions, usage guide, CLI reference, and visual demo
- [x] **DIST-03**: Repository includes .gitignore, LICENSE, and clean package.json metadata for public consumption

### Detection

- [ ] **DTCT-01**: Statusline triggers exercise prompts only during actual Claude Code API calls, not on all statusline updates after first call

### Exercise Intelligence

- [x] **INTL-01**: Each exercise has a muscle group category (push, pull, legs, core) and rotation avoids consecutive same-category exercises
- [x] **INTL-02**: Exercise pool supports timed exercises (planks, wall sits) displayed as "Plank 30s" alongside rep-based exercises
- [x] **INTL-03**: User can define environment profiles (home, office, coworking) that filter exercises by context appropriateness

### Interactive UX

- [ ] **INTR-01**: User can run `vibripped setup` interactive wizard with checkbox equipment selection for guided first-time experience
- [ ] **INTR-02**: User can batch-add exercises from a comma-separated list via `vibripped pool add "Burpees 12, Mountain climbers 20"`
- [ ] **INTR-03**: User can interactively manage pool exercises via checklist view with toggle on/off for each exercise

## v2 Requirements

Deferred to future release. Tracked but not in current roadmap.

### Analytics

- **ANLY-01**: System logs exercise completions with timestamps for optional review
- **ANLY-02**: User can view aggregate movement volume over time

### Advanced Display

- **DISP-01**: Multi-line statusline support — exercise on one line, cooldown timer on another
- **DISP-02**: Live countdown timer for timed exercises in statusline

## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded. Documented to prevent scope creep.

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Workout programming / periodization | This is an execution primitive, not a training plan |
| Technique instruction / form coaching | System assumes user knows the movements |
| Motivational messaging / gamification / streaks | Guilt mechanics cause abandonment; boring systems get used |
| Hook-based trigger system | Statusline-only; hooks add wiring complexity without proven benefit |
| Mobile / external device integration | Lives entirely inside the terminal |
| Random or AI-generated exercises | Pool is curated and bounded — creativity increases variance |
| Sound or desktop notifications | Silent operation is a design invariant |
| Exercise completion logging | Tracking adds friction without proven benefit (deferred to v2) |
| Auto-progressive overload | User controls intensity manually via harder/softer commands |

## Traceability
