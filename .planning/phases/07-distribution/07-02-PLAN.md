<objective>
Create comprehensive README.md documenting VibeRipped for new users and the npm package page.

Purpose: Users discovering VibeRipped on npm or GitHub can understand what it does, install it, configure it, and use all CLI commands without reading source code.
Output: README.md with badges, features, installation, quick start, usage, CLI reference, configuration, demo section, and license.

  <name>Task 1: Create comprehensive README.md</name>

  <action>
Create README.md at project root with the following sections. Write in a concise, technical voice -- no marketing fluff, no exclamation points. The audience is developers who use Claude Code.

**Structure (follow this order exactly):**

1. **Title and badges**: `# VibeRipped` followed by shields.io badges for npm version, license, and Node.js version. Use placeholder URLs that will work once published:
   ```
   [![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/viberipped.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/viberipped)
   [![license](https://img.shields.io/npm/l/viberipped.svg)](LICENSE)
   [![Node.js](https://img.shields.io/node/v/viberipped.svg)](https://nodejs.org)
   ```

2. **One-line description**: "Deterministic micro-exercise rotation engine for Claude Code. Converts model thinking time into movement."

3. **Features** (bullet list, 5-7 items):
   - Sequential rotation through equipment-aware exercise pool
   - Adaptive difficulty scaling based on API latency duration
   - User-controlled difficulty multiplier (harder/softer)
   - Claude Code statusline integration with processing detection
   - GSD workflow coexistence via bash orchestrator
   - Equipment-configurable pool (kettlebell, dumbbells, pull-up bar, parallettes, bodyweight)
   - Zero-friction: one command per prompt, no decisions required

4. **Installation** section:
   ```
   npm install -g viberipped
   ```
   Then note Node.js >= 18 required.

5. **Quick Start** section showing the 3 steps to get running:
   - Step 1: Configure equipment: `vibripped config --kettlebell --dumbbells`
   - Step 2: Test it works: `vibripped test`
   - Step 3: Add to Claude Code settings (reference the statusline provider path `~/.config/viberipped/` or point to Configuration section)

6. **Claude Code Integration** section explaining how to set up the statusline provider:
   - Explain that `statusline.js` is the Claude Code statusline provider script
   - Show the Claude Code settings.json configuration to add the provider
   - Mention the orchestrator (`statusline-orchestrator.sh`) for GSD coexistence
   - Note: the provider detects when the model is actively processing and shows the next exercise

7. **CLI Reference** section documenting every command with examples:
   - `vibripped config [options]` -- Configure equipment and generate exercise pool
     - `--kettlebell / --no-kettlebell`
     - `--dumbbells / --no-dumbbells`
     - `--pull-up-bar / --no-pull-up-bar`
     - `--parallettes / --no-parallettes`
     - Example: `vibripped config --kettlebell --dumbbells --no-parallettes`
   - `vibripped pool list` -- List exercises in current pool
   - `vibripped pool add <name> <reps>` -- Add custom exercise
     - Example: `vibripped pool add "Burpees" 10`
   - `vibripped pool remove <name>` -- Remove exercise from pool
   - `vibripped test` -- Preview next exercise without advancing rotation
   - `vibripped harder` -- Increase difficulty multiplier by one step (0.25 increment, max 2.5x)
   - `vibripped softer` -- Decrease difficulty multiplier by one step (0.25 increment, min 0.5x)

8. **Configuration** section:
   - Config location: `~/.config/viberipped/`
   - Files: `configuration.json` (equipment flags, difficulty), `pool.json` (exercise list), `state.json` (rotation index, cooldown)
   - Note that pool is auto-generated from equipment config but can be manually edited

9. **How It Works** section (brief, 3-4 sentences):
   - Explain the core loop: statusline detects model processing -> picks next exercise from sequential rotation -> displays as compact prompt (e.g., "Pushups x15") -> advances rotation index
   - Mention latency-based rep scaling (longer waits = more reps, capped at 1.5x)
   - Mention user difficulty multiplier (0.5x to 2.5x)
   - Rep bounds: always clamped to [5, 60]

10. **Demo** section:
    - Add a placeholder: `<!-- TODO: Add terminal recording (asciinema/GIF) showing setup and exercise rotation -->`
    - Below placeholder, show a text-based example of what the statusline output looks like during a session

11. **License** section: `MIT` with link to LICENSE file

**Style guidelines:**
- Use fenced code blocks for all commands (with `bash` or `json` language hints)
- Keep examples realistic (use actual exercise names from the default pool like "Pushups", "Kettlebell swings", "Pull-ups")
- Use USERNAME as placeholder for GitHub URLs (same as package.json)
- Do NOT include a Contributing section (not needed yet)
- Do NOT include a Changelog section (deferred per research)

  <verify>
Run `wc -l README.md` -- should be at least 150 lines.
Run `grep -c "vibripped" README.md` -- should find multiple references to the CLI command.
Run `grep -c "##" README.md` -- should find at least 8 section headers.
Visually confirm: has badges, installation command, CLI reference for all 7 commands (config, pool list, pool add, pool remove, test, harder, softer), configuration path, license.
  </verify>
  <done>
README.md exists with all required sections: badges, features, installation, quick start, Claude Code integration, CLI reference (all commands documented with examples), configuration, how it works, demo placeholder, and license. Written in concise technical voice. No fluff, no missing commands.

<success_criteria>
A developer discovering VibeRipped on npm or GitHub can read the README and: (1) understand what it does, (2) install it, (3) configure their equipment, (4) integrate with Claude Code, and (5) use all CLI commands -- without reading source code.
