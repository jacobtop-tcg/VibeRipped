# Milestones

## v1.0 MVP (Shipped: 2026-02-09)

**Phases completed:** 6 phases, 12 plans
**Lines of code:** 4,481 JavaScript
**Tests:** 135 passing
**Timeline:** 2 days (2026-02-08 → 2026-02-09)

**Delivered:** Claude Code statusline provider that converts AI processing latency into deterministic micro-exercise prompts with adaptive difficulty scaling.

**Key accomplishments:**
- Deterministic rotation engine with atomic state persistence and 5-minute cooldown enforcement
- Equipment-configurable exercise pool with transparent JSON storage and user editing
- Claude Code statusline provider with processing detection heuristic and ANSI formatting
- GSD coexistence via bash orchestrator with 💪 visual identity prefix
- Full CLI tooling: config, test, pool list/add/remove commands
- Adaptive difficulty: latency-based rep scaling (1.0-1.5x) with user multiplier (0.5-2.5x), bounds [5-60]
