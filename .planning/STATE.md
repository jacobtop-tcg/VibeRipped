# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-09)

**Core value:** Every "model is thinking" moment produces exactly one unambiguous physical action — no decisions, no coaching, no friction — so the user moves by default instead of browsing by default.

**Current focus:** v1.1 Polish & Intelligence — defining requirements

## Current Position

Milestone: v1.1 Polish & Intelligence
Phase: Not started (defining requirements)
Plan: —
Status: Defining requirements
Last activity: 2026-02-09 — Milestone v1.1 started

Progress: [████████████████████████] 100% (12/12 plans)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 12
- Average duration: 2.6 min
- Total execution time: 0.52 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |

| 01-core-rotation-engine | 2/2 | 6 min | 3 min |
| 02-exercise-pool-configuration | 2/2 | 7 min | 3.5 min |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Full decision log in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Detection heuristic has known limitation (triggers on all updates after first API call) — acceptable for v1, may refine in v2
- Concurrent session state conflicts remain edge case — atomic write-rename mitigates

## Session Continuity

Last session: 2026-02-09
Stopped at: Starting v1.1 milestone — defining requirements
