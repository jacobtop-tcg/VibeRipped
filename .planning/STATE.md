# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-08)

**Core value:** Every "model is thinking" moment produces exactly one unambiguous physical action — no decisions, no coaching, no friction — so the user moves by default instead of browsing by default.

**Current focus:** Phase 5 - End-to-End Integration

## Current Position

Phase: 5 of 6 (CLI Tooling)
Plan: 1 of 2 in current phase
Status: In progress
Last activity: 2026-02-09 — Completed 05-01-PLAN.md (CLI Tooling Foundation)

Progress: [█████████████████░░░] 85%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 9
- Average duration: 2.6 min
- Total execution time: 0.4 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01-core-rotation-engine | 2/2 | 6 min | 3 min |
| 02-exercise-pool-configuration | 2/2 | 7 min | 3.5 min |
| 03-statusline-provider | 2/2 | 3 min | 1.5 min |
| 04-gsd-coexistence | 2/2 | 5 min | 2.5 min |
| 05-cli-tooling | 1/2 | 3 min | 3 min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 03-02 (2min), 04-01 (2min), 04-02 (3min), 05-01 (3min)
- Trend: Sustained high velocity

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Statusline provider approach (not hook-based) — self-contained, polled by Claude Code
- Process detection via heuristics — stdin JSON delta tracking since no "is processing" flag exposed
- Equipment-configurable pool — user declares gear once, pool assembles automatically
- Sequential rotation (not random) — predictability builds trust and reduces cognitive overhead
- Write-file-atomic for state persistence — atomic write-rename prevents corruption from crashes (01-01)
- SHA256 for pool hashing — deterministic, collision-resistant change detection (01-01)
- Fail-safe validation with reset-to-defaults — invalid state never crashes engine (01-01)
- XDG Base Directory compliance — state at ~/.config/viberipped/ with secure permissions (01-01)
- TDD with Node.js built-in test runner — zero external dependencies, fast execution (01-02)
- Sentinel value 0 for "never triggered" — first trigger always allowed, simple check (01-02)
- Crisp command format "{name} x{reps}" — zero motivational language, pure data (01-02)
- bypassCooldown option for testing — deterministic rotation tests without time delays (01-02)
- EQUIPMENT_KEYS duplicated in pool.js — avoids circular dependency between config/state/pool modules (02-01)
- Bodyweight exercises in FULL_EXERCISE_DATABASE match DEFAULT_POOL — backward compatibility preserved (02-01)
- Partial config support with missing keys treated as false — flexible equipment declaration (02-01)
- Pool assembly never returns empty pool — bodyweight always included, DEFAULT_POOL fallback (02-01)
- Config-driven mode via null pool parameter — backward compatible with Phase 1 explicit pool tests (02-02)
- Double-hash tracking (configPoolHash + poolHash) — separates config change detection from user edit detection (02-02)
- pool.json regeneration only on config change — preserves user edits when configuration.json unchanged (02-02)
- pool.json pretty-printed with 2-space indent — human-readable for transparency and manual editing (02-02)
- Process detection uses MEDIUM confidence heuristic — positive tokens = processing, requires empirical validation (03-01)
- formatExercise decoupled from engine types — accepts primitives (name, reps) for single responsibility (03-01)
- Explicit null AND undefined checks in detection — zero tokens semantically different from null (03-01)
- Zero tokens means "not processing" — session started but no Claude activity yet (03-01)
- Detection heuristic validated with known limitation — triggers on all statusline updates after first API call, not just during active processing (acceptable for MVP) (03-02)
- VIBERIPPED_BYPASS_COOLDOWN=1 env var added — enables deterministic testing by bypassing cooldown (03-02)
- statusline.js uses process.stdout.write — clean output without trailing newline (03-02)
- Silent operation on all error paths — exit 0 with no stdout preserves statusline stability (03-02)
- Integration tests use isolated HOME dirs — prevents test interference with user state (03-02)
- Flexed biceps emoji (💪) as VibeRipped visual identity prefix — unambiguous distinction from GSD output (04-01)
- Bash orchestrator with configurable separator (Unicode │) — simple, portable, no runtime dependencies (04-01)
- Conditional concatenation prevents orphaned separators — separator only when both providers active (04-01)
- Provider failures isolated with || echo "" pattern — one provider crashing never breaks the other (04-01)
- Orchestrator as production statusline provider — enables real-world coexistence validation and production deployment (04-02)
- Commander negatable options for equipment flags — --kettlebell and --no-kettlebell pattern for intuitive CLI UX (05-01)
- Immediate pool.json generation on config save — single-command workflow satisfies equipment declaration requirement (05-01)
- dryRun option in engine.js for state-preserving preview — test command shows next exercise without advancing rotation (05-01)
- Absolute path requires in CLI modules — path.join(__dirname, '../relative/path') avoids relative path resolution issues (05-01)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

**Phase 3 (Statusline Provider):**
- ✓ RESOLVED: Process detection heuristic validated via real Claude Code session. Known limitation (triggers on all updates after first API call) acceptable for MVP.

**Phase 4 (GSD Coexistence):**
- ✓ RESOLVED: Composite statusline validated in production. Both GSD and VibeRipped segments display correctly with clear visual separation. Flexed biceps emoji prefix provides instant recognition.
- Multi-instance state conflicts if user runs multiple Claude Code sessions simultaneously. Atomic write-rename mitigates but concurrent read-modify-write remains edge case.
- Detection heuristic has known limitation (triggers on all updates after first API call) - may refine in future based on user feedback.
